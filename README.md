# <img src="https://iam-weijie.github.io/wave/hand-emoji.svg" alt="Animated Emoji" width="50" height="50"> Hey, I’m Hamza

I’m a **Cloud & DevOps engineer in progress**, currently strengthening skills in **Linux, AWS, Terraform, automation, and cloud-native architectures**.  
I enjoy building hands-on cloud projects, designing scalable systems, and continuously improving as I work toward becoming a reliable platform engineer.

I enjoy working close to the platform — monitoring systems, investigating issues, automating infrastructure, and collaborating with developers to keep environments reliable and secure.

## 🔧 What I’m currently working on

+ Strengthening Linux system administration fundamentals (IBM Linux course)

+ Building Terraform projects (VPC, networking, security groups, IaC best practices)

+ Developing serverless architectures on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront)

+ Learning CI/CD fundamentals and deployment workflows

+ I regularly share progress, documentation, and projects here as I continue developing as a cloud engineer.
