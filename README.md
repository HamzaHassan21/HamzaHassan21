# <img src="https://iam-weijie.github.io/wave/hand-emoji.svg" alt="Animated Emoji" width="50" height="50"> Hey, I’m Hamza

I’m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer in progress, building strong foundations in AWS, Terraform, automation, and cloud-native architectures. I enjoy designing scalable systems, working close to the platform, and continuously improving reliability through hands-on projects and learning.

I’m particularly interested in platform engineering, including monitoring systems, investigating issues, automating infrastructure, and collaborating with developers to keep environments secure and reliable.

## What I’m currently working on

- Building Terraform-based infrastructure projects (VPCs, networking, security groups, IaC best practices)

- Developing and refining CI/CD pipelines and deployment workflows

- Expanding hands-on experience with AWS serverless and cloud architectures (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront)

- Improving automation and operational practices for cloud-based systems
