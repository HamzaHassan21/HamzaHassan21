👋 Hi, I'm Hamza Hassan
🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm Hamza — a Cloud & DevOps engineer in progress, currently developing strong skills in Linux, AWS, Terraform, and automation. I enjoy building hands-on cloud projects, designing scalable infrastructure, and continuously improving as I work toward becoming a Solutions Architect.

I'm currently working on:

Linux mastery (IBM course)

Terraform projects (VPC, networking, automation)

Serverless & cloud-native architectures

CI/CD fundamentals

I share my progress and projects here as I grow into a cloud engineer.
